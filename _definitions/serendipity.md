**Serendipity** (noun): The occurrence of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.

From the Persian fairy tale "The Three Princes of Serendip," who were always making discoveries of things they weren't looking for.

The best research happens through serendipity—stumbling upon insights while investigating something else entirely. You can't plan for it, but you can create conditions that increase its likelihood: read widely, follow curiosity, keep your eyes open.
